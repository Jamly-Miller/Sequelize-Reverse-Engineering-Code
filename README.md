# Sequelize - Reverse Engineering Code

## Description

This is A Google Slides tutorial explaining every file and its purpose in ``` Develop ``` folder to reverse engineer the starter code. 

## User Story

AS A developer,

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase,

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project.

## Usage

```
When joining a new team, we will be expected to inspect a lot of code that we have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for us, we will dissect the code by ourselves, saving any questions for a member of our team.

```


## **Installation**

Node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/

MySQL Workbench (If you are a new user of MySQL, download at): https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Init and Install npm : https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm


## **Required Dependencies**

Express npm package (by running ``` npm install express ``` )

Bcryptjs npm package (by running ``` npm install bcryptjs ``` )

MySQL npm package (by running ``` npm install mysql ``` )

Express-session npm package (by running ``` npm install express-session ``` )

Passport npm package (by running ``` npm install passport ``` )

Passport-local npm package (by running ``` npm install passport-local ``` )

Sequelize npm package (by running ``` npm install package ``` )


## Technologies

* HTML (frontEnd layout)

* CSS (frontEnd styling)

* Express.js (backEnd framework)

* JSON (save and retrieve data)

* Sequelize (transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading)


## Testes

Test application by running ``` node server.js ``` inside the Terminal.


## Fun

This time, I got to analysis other's code instead of code it myself.


##  Challenges

I needed even deeper understanding of all the code and technologies and relationsips between files than code it myself.
